</p>

<dl>
<dt>(1) Regular papers (long papers)</dt>
<dd> 
<p>
High quality papers (at most 10 pages) that establish significant
results and ideas are solicited in this category.  Papers must be
written in English.

All submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee for
sustaining the quality of presentations in the meeting, selection of
accepted papers and award selection. The program committee expects
that the review reports will help the author(s) submit the revised
papers to international conferences/journals in the near future.
Review reports will be sent to the author(s) in English or
Japanese. The author(s) may ask reviewers to write reports in English
at the submission.
</p>
<p>
The author(s) of each accepted paper must
register for the meeting to give an oral presentation, either in
English or in Japanese. 
Presentation slides should be written either in English or in Japanese, too.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>(2) Regular papers (short papers) </dt>
<dd>
<p>
High quality papers (4-6 pages) that establish significant results

meeting will be also accepted.
</p>
<p>
The author(s) of each accepted paper must

the availability of presentation slots.  The original papers are used
only for the proposal selection process.
</p>
<p>
For each accepted proposal, the author(s) of the original paper must
register for the meeting to give an oral presentation, either in

<h4> [Limited Access to Accepted Papers] </h4>

<p>
ACSI does not publish any proceedings. The papers accepted for ACSI
are not opened to the public. Copies of the accepted papers will be
distributed only to attendees of the ACSI2016, during the meeting
dates and one week after the meeting.
</p>

<h4> [Submission Regulations for Regular Papers] </h4>
<p>
The IEEE conference style (US letter or A4 size) should
be used for the regular papers submission. The page limit for long papers is 10
pages, and 6 pages for short papers. It must be an original work,
which has not appeared in and has not been accepted for other
peer-reviewed conferences or journals, domestic or international, of
all categories including regular papers, letters, and technical
notes. Papers that are included in or accepted for journals or conferences
but the publications (e.g. proceedings) are not assigned either ISBN or ISSN
number can be submitted.
</p>

<p>
The template of the IEEE conference style is available at
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>. Please submit a PDF file of your manuscript following this style. A submission not following the page limit and the style would be rejected.
</p>

<h4> [Award for Regular Papers] </h4> 

<p> ACSI2016 program committee selects at most one "ACSI2016 Outstanding
Research Award" in each track. 
</p>
<p>
Moreover,
ACSI2016 gives "ACSI2016 Outstanding Student Research Award" for the best paper
written by a student. To be qualified the student award, the first
author should be a student and she/he must present the work in the
meeting. A student working for a company is entitled to the award only when he/she has done the work as a student.
</p>

<p>
Above two awards are mainly selected from the view point of
quality of the research, its practicality and potential. Additionally,
the presentation quality is taken into account for the evaluation of
the paper. No paper may receive both awards.
</p>

<h4> [IPSJ Transactions on ACS: Special issue on ACSI] </h4>
<p>
There is a special issue on ACSI in the ACS transactions, which will
be announced about three weeks after the notification of ACSI review
results. ACSI program committee cooperates with ACS editors to aim
quicker review response than the regular issue of ACS. Please note,
however, that the special issue is judged according to the criterion
of ACS transactions, which is not identical to that for ACSI.
</p>

<h4> [Submissions] </h4>
<p> All papers should be submitted through EasyChair.  The opening of
the submission site is to be announced in ACSI2016 web page
(http://acsi.hpcc.jp/2016/). The author(s) is (are) requested to
choose one of the following three tracks that most closely matches the
submitted paper when submitting. Note that the author(s) may submit a
paper without choosing a track if it is difficult. In this case, the
program committee will determine a suitable track for the submitted
paper. In addition, even though the author(s) chose a track for the
submission, the program committee would move the paper to another
track when necessary.
