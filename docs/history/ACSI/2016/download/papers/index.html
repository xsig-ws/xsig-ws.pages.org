<li>(K1) Approaches to the power consumption problem on the K computer<br />
Atsuya Uno (RIKEN AICS)<br />
Abstract:
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Recently, high-performance computing systems have become larger and
larger, and reducing their power consumptions has become one of the
important issues. The K computer has the same situation and we faced
on how to reduce its power consumption in the operation. K computer
has been operated for more than three years. At the beginning of the
shared use, we thought no application could consume the electric power
more than that of LINPACK. However, the system power consumption
sometimes exceeded the limit of power supply. As measures to this
problem, we have tried to control the system power consumption by
estimating the power consumption of large jobs and adjusting the
execution timing of them manually. In addition, we have analyzed the
relation between the application performance and power consumption on
K computer. In this talk, these approaches will be presented.

<li>(K3) Challenges in Power Constrained High Performance Computing<br />
Koji Inoue, Yuichi Inadomi and Takatsugu Ono (Kyushu University)<br />
Abstract:<br />
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Power efficiency is a primary concern in current and future computer systems. With the end of Dennard Scaling, it is difficult to improve processor performance without affecting power, and the leaps needed for   Modern processors suffer from increasingly large power variations owing to the chip manufacturing process. These variations lead to power inhomogeneity in current systems and manifest into performance inhomogeneity in power-constrained environments, resulting in poor system performance. To tackle with this issue, we have proposed a novel variation-aware power budgeting scheme to maximize effective application performance. Our low-cost and scalable budgeting algorithm strives to achieve performance homogeneity under a power constraint by deriving application-specific, module-level power allocations. Experimental results using a 1,920-socket system show up to 5.4X speedup, with an average speedup of 1.8X across all benchmarks, compared to a variation-unaware power allocation scheme.

<li>(K4) Verifying effectiveness of packet pacing on large-scale parallel programs by simulation<br />
Hidetomo Shibamura (Institute of Systems, Information Technologies and Nanotechnologies)<br />
Abstract:<br />
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
This study aims to show the effectiveness of packet pacing on practical application by interconnect simulation.  Packet pacing is one of congestion avoidance techniques where communication packets are sent intermittently while adjusting inter-packet gap to reduce communication time.  The gap value is pre-calculated for each communication according to the communication hop, and the value is explicitly passed to a sending function.  A large effect of packet pacing on some collective communications had been confirmed in a previous study.  In this study, we applied packet pacing to the main communication part of Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM). NICAM communication was simulated by an interconnect simulator NSIM based on MGEN program which generates communication message.  An MGEN program for NICAM communication was created and two node-mapping methods for 3D-Torus were designed.  Communication times for each message size were examined while changing the inter-packet gap.  In addition, similar examinations considering imbalance of the communication start time were performed.  The estimated time of NICAM communication without packet pacing was about 2.2 times slower than a theoretical value because of network congestion.  Then, the estimated time with packet pacing was about 2.0 times faster than without one and very closer to the theoretical value.

<li>(K5) A Framework for Jointing Computation Center with User-Level Management System<br />
Hideyuki Jitsumoto (Tokyo Institute of Technology)
<br />
Abstract:<br />
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Coupled method become important execution scenario for advanced scientific application. It achieve more accurate and large-scale simulation because it can use many calculation resources with jointing supercomputer centers loosely. For jointing centers, the collaboration with management system for supercomputer such as scheduler are indispensable. However, the collaboration takes a hell of a time owing to these management system operates with individual policy for each center. In order to solve this problem, we make application coupling framework with user-level management. Therefore, many coupled scientific application can execute promptly without solving policy problem between multiple supercomputing centers. The framework fill the gap of operation policy on each center with configuration which is described by user. This framework is constructed with 1) Point-of-Presence server which coordinates management system on jointed center and manages messages between coupled application, and 2) communication API used from user application. In addition, the communication between PoP servers connected with SSH tunneling. Application user can got jointed environment flexibly with minimal efforts. We will introduce the design and implementation of this framework and its execution scenario.

Takashi Shimokawabe (Tokyo Institute of Technology)<br />
Abstract:<br />
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Numerical weather prediction is one of the major applications in high-performance computing and on GPU supercomputers. Obtaining good parallel efficiency using more than thousand GPUs often requires skillful programming, for example, both MPI for the inter-node communication and NVIDIA GPUDirect for the intra-node communication. Our framework-based weather prediction code ASUCA has achieved good scalability with hiding complicated implementation and optimizations required for distributed GPUs, contributing to increasing the maintainability; ASUCA is a high-resolution meso-scale atmospheric model developed by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Our framework automatically translates user-written functions that update a grid point and generates both GPU and CPU codes. The framework provides C++ classes to describe stencil access pattern, loop calculation and GPU-GPU communication easily and effectively. User-written codes are parallelized by MPI with intra-node GPU peer-to-peer direct access and overlapping techniques to hide communication overhead by computation. The programmers write user's code just in the C++ language and can develop program code optimized for GPU supercomputers without introducing complicated optimizations for GPU computation and GPU-GPU communication. We will show the implementation and programming model of the proposed framework, and the performance evaluation of framework-based ASUCA on the TSUBAME2.5 supercomputer at Tokyo Institute of Technology.

<li>(K7) Development of numerical optimization tool for polycrystalline metallic microstructure control by using multi-phase-field method<br />
Akinori Yamanaka (Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology)<br />
Abstract:<br />
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Strength and ductility of metallic materials are strongly influenced by size and distribution of their underlying polycrystalline microstructures. Therefore, understanding and prediction of microstructure formation in materials are very important for practical materials development. Recently, the multi-phase-field (MPF) method has attracted much attention as a powerful numerical tool for simulating three-dimensional (3D) microstructure formations on the basis of total free energy theory. However, for simulating realistic formation process ofmicrostructures, 3D MPF simulation requires huge computational cost. Therefore, we have developed multiple-GPU computing technique and overlapping method for accelerating large-scale 3D MPF simulation. Using our technique, large-scale 3D MPF simulation of polycrystalline grain growth in a material containing finely dispersed particles was performed on the TSUBAME2.5 supercomputer at Tokyo Institute of Technology. The results demonstrated our multiple-GPU computation technique achieved very good performance scalability in the large-scale 3D MPF simulations.

<li>(K8) Interaction between a huge number of micro particles with internal degrees of freedom and turbulent mixing<br />
Toshiyuki Gotoh (Nagoya Institute of Technology)<br />
Abstract:<br />
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px">
Clouds are ubiquitous and key to the accurate numerical prediction of the weather and future climate, but have resisted to be unveiled because of difficulty of measurement and observation. Cloud droplets (about 10 &micro;m radius) grow up into the rain drops (larger than 100 &micro;m) by the condensation and collision-coalescence, and modify the flow itself through the buoyancy force due to the latent heat release. In order to answer many questions such as how fast the cloud droplets evolve into the rain drops, we have been developing the cloud microphysics simulator which can simulate the whole process of the cloud drop evolution. Highly parallelized three dimensional FFT for the turbulent flow computation and the various acceleration techniques for the droplet collision process are the core in the present study. Equations of a large number of cloud droplets which are convected and mixed with the water vapor by the turbulent flow are numerically integrated and the various data of cloud droplets are gathered. The numerical method developed in this study is also applicable to other problems in the engineering. Simulation of the line polymers in fluid is a typical example. Recent progresses on these topics will be delivered.
