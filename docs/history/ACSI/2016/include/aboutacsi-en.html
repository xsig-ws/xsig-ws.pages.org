ACSI (Annual Meeting on Advanced Computing System and Infrastructure)
gives researchers in Japan an opportunity to present their work on a wide
variety of topics about advanced computing systems, practical
infrastructures, and technologies for enabling them. The first ACSI
meeting was held in January 2015 as a successor to the JSPP and SACSIS
symposium series. By discussing recent advances, future directions, and
practical experiences of these systems and technologies from wide and
various viewpoints, ACSI promotes sharing of research experiences in Japan
and the development of technologies. In addition, ACSI gives researchers
an opportunity to get feedback from the reviewers and attendees with
various backgrounds, and encourages submissions of revised versions of the
work to international conferences or refereed journals. For this purpose,
accepted papers are distributed only to attendees and not opened to the
public. The encouragement aims to promote international activities in the
relevant domestic research community.
