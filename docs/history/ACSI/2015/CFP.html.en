<h4> Call for Papers </h4> 

Annual Meeting on Advanced Computing System and Infrastructure: 
<a href="http://acsi.hpcc.jp/">ACSI2015</a>
<p></p>

<h4> [Important Dates] </h4>
<?php include("include/important-dates-en.html");?>

<h4> [Overview] </h4>

<?php include("include/aboutacsi-en.html");?>

<h4> [Publications] </h4>

<p>
The ACSI does not publish any proceedings. The papers accepted for
ACSI are not opened to the public. The copy of the accepted paper is
distributed only to attendees of the ACSI2015, which means that the
ACSI is a closed meeting for the attendees.
</p>

<h4> [Regular papers] </h4> 

<ul> 

<li> High quality papers that establish significant results and ideas
are solicited in this category. Papers must be written in English, and
be within ten pages. A PDF file based on the IEEE conference style
should be used for the submission. It must be an original work, which
has not appeared in and has not been accepted for other peer-reviewed
conferences or journals, domestic or international, of all categories
including regular papers, letters, and technical notes. Papers
included in or accepted for journals or conferences whose publications
(e.g. proceedings) do not have either ISBN or ISSN number can be
submitted.

<li> The template of the IEEE conference style is available in
http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html.

<li> Please strictly follow the manuscript format: language (English),
page limit (10 pages), style (IEEE conference style).
</ul>

<h4> [Award for regular papers] </h4> 

<p> ACSI2015 program committee selects at most one "Outstanding
Research Award" in each track (ACSI2015 has three tracks). Moreover,
ACSI2015 gives "Outstanding Student Research Award" for the best paper
written by a student. To be qualified the student award, the first
author should be a student and she/he must present the work in the
meeting. </p>

<p> Above two awards are mainly selected from the view point of
quality of the research, its practicality and potential. Additionally,
the presentation quality is taken into account for the evaluation of
the paper.
</p>

<h4> [IPSJ Transactions on ACS: Special issue on ACSI] </h4>

<p>
There is a special issue on ACSI in the ACS transactions, which will
be announced about three weeks after the notification of ACSI review
results. ACSI program committee cooperates with ACS editors to aim
quicker review response than the regular issue of ACS. Please note,
however, that the special issue is judged according to the criterion
of ACS transactions, which is not identical to that for ACSI.
</p>

<h4> [Poster papers] </h4>

<p>
There will be a call for posters after the notification of regular
papers. Submissions will be opened in December. Poster paper must be a
one or two page paper written in English. IEEE conference style should
be used. ACSI solicits especially the early-stage or problem-raising
works for the poster presentation and provides a place to discuss them
with attendees.
</p>

<p>
ACSI program committee gives an award for excellent poster presentations.
</p>

<h4> [Submissions] </h4>

<p> The paper should be submitted through EasyChair. The opening of
the submission site will be announced in ACSI2015 web page
(http://acsi.hpcc.jp/2015/index.html) in September.
<p>

<p>
When the authors submit the paper to ACSI2015, they should choose one
of the following three tracks that most closely match your work.
</p>

<dl>
<li> Track A: Applications and algorithms (chair: Daisuke Takahashi)<br>

Computational science, simulations, high performance computing, numerical algorithm and libraries, auto tuning, large-scale data processing algorithms, power-saving algorithms, algorithmic fault tolerance

<li> Track B: Programming and systems software (chair: Kento Aida)<br>

Operating systems, programming language design and implementation, virtualization technology, data intensive computing systems (MapReduce, KVS), file systems, databases, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, grid computing, security, communication libraries, wide area networking, large scale system management and evaluation

<li> Track C: System architecture (chair: Kenji Kise)<br>

Processor architecture, memory architecture, network architecture, heterogeneous architecture (GPU, many cores), reconfigurable systems, embedded systems, application-specific architecture, dependable systems, low power design
