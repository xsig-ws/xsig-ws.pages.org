ACSI is an annual meeting held by four IPSJ research groups, ARC, HPC,
OS and PRO. ACSI aims to be a forum in which people can discuss recent
advances and future directions of computing technologies from various
viewpoints. It has broad interests in systems, infrastructures, and
key components that advance computing systems. ACSI welcome papers
describing novel cutting-edge technologies and/or case studies useful
to others.
