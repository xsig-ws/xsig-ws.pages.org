    <li> <a id="S1-1">Expectations for optical network from the viewpoint of system software research</a><br>
Ryousei Takano (AIST)<br>
<br>
Recently, some innovative data center architectures have been proposed
from both academia and industry, for instance, Open Compute Project,
UCB ASPIRE FireBox, Intel Rack scale architecture, and HP the
machine. "Disaggregation" is a keyword of such architectures.
Computers are divided into their component parts and a rack-scale or
data center-scale computer is re-aggregated from the resource pool to
meet users' requirements. Optical network is a promising technology to
connect components with huge bandwidth and low power consumption. To
utilize such advantages from applications, there are research
opportunities for system software.  This talk presents expectations or
optical network in future data center and HPC from the viewpoint of
system software research through the survey of such a trend.

    <li> <a id="S1-2">Optical fiber network system for next generation data center</a><br>
Haruhiko Kuwatsuka (AIST)<br>
<br>
New optical fiber network systems will provide ultra wide band,
flexible, and low power-consumption inter connections between
computing nodes in data centers of big data era. A lot of advanced
technologies developed for optical communication systems, such as
optical coherent technology, DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division
Multiplexing) technology, light source technologies including comb
light sources, ROADM (Re-configurable Optical Add Drop Multiplexing)
and various optical switching technologies, will be used in
combination for the new optical fiber network systems of the data
centers. OXC (Optical CROSS connect) switches developed in VICTOREIS
(Vertically Integrated Center for Technologies of Optical Routing
toward Ideal Energy Savings) will be useful for the optical network
systems. A new concept of wavelength bank and distributing systems
will be discussed, in which DWDM CW's (Continuous Waves) generated
from a central-controlled comb light sources, which is called
wavelength bank, are distributed to each computing node and each
computing node selects some of CW's and generates signal waves by
them. The signal waves from each node are sent to a target node by OXC
switching systems. The development of low cost, low power-consumption
and highly integrated optical devices by using new technologies such
as Si photonics is indispensable for the systems.

    <li> <a id="S1-3">Photonic and Electronic Convergence Technologies for 1-chip Data Center</a><br>
Jun Inasaka (NEC/PETRA)<br>
<br>
High-end Servers and High-performance Computers are facing the three
huge walls such as memory wall, power wall and high speed electrical
transmission wall. These walls have slowed down the sustained
performance and the power efficient especially in the large scale
system. But these walls might be broken by integrating photonics and
Through Silicon Via (TSV) technology to the LSI, server board and rack
in the near future. We have developed 5 mm square Si-photonics-based
chip-scale optical transmitters/receivers called "optical I/O
cores". The power consumption of their hybrid-integrated ICs is 5
mW/Gbps. We demonstrated 25-Gbps/ch error-free operation in the O
band. There is great demand for optical interconnections in
high-performance computers because they can cover the long
transmission distances that electrical interconnections cannot as the
data rate increases. We will integrate this optical IO cores to CPU
module as a high speed optical interface beside CPU, in order to solve
the I/O bottleneck. And we also have developed TSV process to
integrate into Si-photonics chip for Silicon Optical Interposers and
the high-performance 1-chip Data Center.
