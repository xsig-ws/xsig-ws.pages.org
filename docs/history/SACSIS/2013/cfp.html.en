      <h4>Overview</h4> 
    SACSIS (Symposium on Advanced Computing Systems and Infrastructures) is a forum that started at year 2003.  The eleventh event of this series happens in Sendai, from May 22 (Wed) thru 24 (Fri), 2013.  The general interests include but are not limited to:

<ul>

<li>Advanced Computing Technologies<br>

    SACSIS aims to be a forum in which interested people discusses
    recent advances and future directions of computing technologies
    from various view points.  It has a broad interest in systems,
    infrastructures, and key components that advance computing
    systems.

<li>Systems and Infrastructures<br>

    SACSIS is broadly interested in systems and infrastructures at
    work focusing on practicality, usability, and applicability; the
    interest is not limited to novel cutting-edge technologies.

</ul>

      <p>

	We widely solicit papers that describe novel ideas,
	experiences useful to others including implementation and case
	studies, systems and infrastructures of practical importance
	from the following fields.

      </p>
<!--      <?php include("include/theme-en.html");?> -->
      
<ul>
<li>    Computational science applications
<li>    Numerical algorithms and libraries
<li>    Large scale data analysis
<li>    High performance computing environments (supercomputers, clusters, and clouds)
<li>    Programming languages and libraries
<li>    Operating systems
<li>    High performance networking
<li>    Computer architecture

</ul>

      <h4>Submission Categories</h4>

      <p><strong>[Regular Papers]</strong></p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  High quality papers that established significant results and
	  ideas are solicited in this category.  Papers must be
	  written in Japanese or English, and must be within eight A4
	  pages.  They must be original work that have not appeared in
	  or are under review for other peer-reviewed conferences or
	  journals, domestic or international, of all categories
	  including regular papers, letters, technical notes, and
	  post-deadline papers (the rule is different from ACS
	  transaction).  Papers that appeared in journals or
	  conferences whose publications (e.g. proceedings) do not
	  have ISBN or ISSN can be submitted.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  SACSIS gives a <b>best paper award</b> to the best paper in
	  this category.  It is selected based on significance and
	  quality of the research as well as its presentation in the
	  paper.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	  SACSIS gives <b>young researcher award</b> to up to three
	  papers written by young researchers.  To be eligible, the
	  primary author of the paper must be approximately thirty or
	  younger.  The awards aim at honoring promising young
	  researchers and appreciate researches that offer interesting
	  view points and hopes in their further developments.
	</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p id="notice"><strong>[*** Transaction on ACS: Special issue on SACSIS ***]</strong></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    From the last year, there are no calls for SACSIS/ACS
	    combined (simultaneous) submissions, which SACSIS/ACS used
	    to solicit in past years.  There will instead be a special
	    issue on SACSIS in the ACS transaction, which will be
	    announced about three weeks after the notification of
	    SACSIS review results.  In this issue, submissions based
	    on a paper that appeared in SACSIS is refereed by the same
	    referees who reviewed the SACSIS paper, and thus will be
	    reviewed faster than regular submissions.  SACSIS
	    committee encourages authors to submit papers based on
	    their SACSIS papers to this special issue.  Please note,
	    however, that the special issue is judged according to the
	    criterion of ACS transaction, which are not identical to those of
	    SACSIS.
	  </li><br>
	   
	   <li>
	     Remarks: there will be call for papers to ACS transaction
	     in mid December before SACSIS; papers submitted to this
	     issue of ACS transaction cannot be submitted to SACSIS.
	   </li>
	</ol>

	   <p><strong>[Exploratory short papers]</strong></p>
	   <ol>
	   <li>
	     Papers that explore promising directions with useful
	     results and ideas are solicited in this category.  Papers
	     must be written in Japanese or English, and must be
	     within four A4 pages.  We not only welcome papers that
	     have established results but also appreciate research in
	     progress of which the community looks forward to further
	     development.  They must be original work that have not
	     appeared in or are under review for other peer-reviewed
	     conferences or journals, domestic or international, of
	     all categories including regular papers, letters,
	     technical notes, and post-deadline papers (the rule is
	     different from ACS transaction).  Papers that appeared in
	     journals or conferences whose publications
	     (e.g. proceedings) do not have ISBN or ISSN can be
	     submitted.
	   </li><br>
	   
	   <li> Remarks: similarly to regular papers, papers submitted
	     to the issue of ACS transaction due in December cannot be
	     submitted to SACSIS.
	   </li>
	   </ol>
	</p>

	     <p><strong>[Poster papers]</strong></p>
      <ol>
	<li>
	  There will be call for poster papers after the notification
	  of regular/exploratory papers.  Submissions will be open in 
	  mid March.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	  Poster papers are also reviewed, but we actively accept
	  early-stage researches, problem-raising researches, etc.
	  and provide a place to discuss them with symposium
	  participants.
	</li><br>
	<li>
	  SACSIS gives excellent poster award and excellent student
	  poster award.  The former will be given to the best poster 
	  among all accepted posters.  The latter will be selected
	  from posters presented by students.
	</li>

      The authors should choose one of the following tracks that most
      closely match your work.  In case the work does not clearly fit
      any particular track or it is difficult to choose one with other
      reasons, it may be left unspecified.  The program committee will
      then decide an appropriate track.  When appropriate, the
      committee may also move your submission to a track different from
      the one specified.
