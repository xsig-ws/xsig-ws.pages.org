Parallel computing is rapidly evolving to include heterogeneous
collections of distributed and parallel systems.  Concurrently,
applications are becoming increasingly multidisciplinary with code
libraries implemented using diverse programming models.  To optimize
the behavior of complex applications on heterogeneous systems,
performance analysis software must also evolve, replacing post-mortem
analysis with real-time, adaptive optimization, tightly
integrating compile-time analysis with performance measurement and
prediction, and supporting high-modality visualization and software
manipulation.  In this paper, we briefly survey the state of the art in
each of these areas and sketch a series of open research problems.
