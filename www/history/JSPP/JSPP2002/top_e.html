<h2>NOTICE: 2002/1/24: Deadline Extension</h2>
<p>In response to requests from several authors, we will extend our
deadline until Jan 28 (Mon), 24:00 JST. <font color="red">Paper
registration must still be done until the original due (1/25(Fri)
9:00am).</font></p>
<p>Paper submission consists of two phases, "registration" of your
paper (title, authors, etc.) and "upload" of your paper. Please finish
"registration" until the original deadline. And please finish "upload"
until Jan 28 (Mon) 24:00.</p>
<p>Authors who have submitted before the original deadline
can revise the paper and upload it again.</p>

<br> <hr WIDTH="100%"> <p> Joint Symposium on Parallel Processing is a
forum on parallel processing where researchers on all fields in
parallel processing, including theory, software, architecture, and
applications, meet and exchange their ideas. This year, it will be
held May 29, 2002 thru 31 in Tsukuba. We invite papers describing
original/proven ideas, those reporting on experiences and
implementation efforts, as well as those describing developing and
ongoing work.
</p>

<p><hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>Topics</h2>
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>global computing, cluster computing, peer-to-peer computing, 
fault-tolerant and dependable computing
<li>processor architecture, system architecture
<li>storage, database, data mining, World Wide Web
<li>bioinformatics, scientific computing, multimedia, computer
graphics, realtime processing, low-power computing, mobile computing,
<li>security, OS/middleware, programming language, compiler, computation model
<li>algorithm
<li>performance evaluation
<li>other parallel and distributed computing technologies
</ul>
</p>

<p><hr WIDTH="100%"> <h2> Remarks </h2> 
JSPP2002 is different from the past series of the symposia in several
ways. Read the following carefully before you send a paper.

<ol>
<li> We invite regular papers in two categories, namely "long papers"
and "short papers."  Long papers should be no longer than 8 pages and
short papers 4 pages.  In addition, we solicit posters.

<li> All submissions must be done electronically (through
http://www.hpcc.jp/jspp02/submit/).

<li> The category "long papers" solicits high quality papers that
bring new research results. Authors submitting to this category can
co-submit the same material to "IPSJ transactions on high performance
systems (HPS)". This way papers in this category can appear in the
transaction with a prompt reviewing process (decisions on
acceptance/rejection are made independently).

<li> The program commitee will award the best student paper from the
long papers.

<li> The category "short papers" welcomes not only accomplished work,
but also work in progress with original ideas and/or methodologies.
JSPP2002 is meant to be a forum in which these developing ideas are
exchanged and discussed.

<li> Both long papers and short papers should describe original work
that has not been published elsewhere.

<li> Oral presentations for the accepted long and short papers are
scheduled in the symposium program.

<li> Posters accept, among others, work in early stages and
proposals. JSPP2002 provides opportunities where participants can
exchange and discuss ideas in an informal fashion.

<li> Topics of interest include not only traditional prallel
processing (e.g., parallel architectures and scientific applications)
but also emerging topics such as wide area distributed computing, mass
storage systems, bioinformatics, and security. The program committee
specifically encourages researchers in these fields to send papers
broadly relevant to parallel processing.
